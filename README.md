# Corner Store on 45th
CPSC 210 term project: r8a9v, 25860198

## Description
The application will function as a store management game with small story elements 
attatched. As a player, your objective is to
buy stock, upgrade your store, and
make rent every 5 days. Stock goes on clearance (loses value) after 2 days
so buy responsibly!
- This project is of interest to me since I ultimately want to be a 
game developer, and story driven content is extremely fascinating to me

# *User stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add stock items to my inventory.
- As a user, I want to view my inventory and the items I have in stock.
- As a user, I want to unlock better stock items with the money I make.
- As a user, I want to observe and interact with customers. 
- As a user, I want to gain experience points that allow me to "level up"
and grant access to better items.
